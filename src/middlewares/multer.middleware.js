/*
    SUMMARY:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ `req` (request object) is automatically passed to the function. 
       - It contains details about the user making the request.
       - It can be used to verify authentication before uploading files.
       - Even if unused here, it allows customization (e.g., saving files in user-specific folders).

    2Ô∏è‚É£ `file` represents the uploaded file.
       - It contains properties like `originalname`, `mimetype`, `size`, etc.
       - Used in `filename` to retain the original file name.
       - Can help with file validation (e.g., filtering by type or size).

    3Ô∏è‚É£ `cb` (callback function) is used to pass the destination and filename to multer.
       - This is how multer knows where to store the file and what name to use.

    4Ô∏è‚É£ The file is first uploaded to the **backend server** and stored temporarily in `./public/temp`.
       - After that, it can be uploaded to a cloud storage service like **Cloudinary**.
       - Once uploaded to Cloudinary, the temporary file on the backend server can be deleted.

    üî• Conclusion:
    - This 2-step process ensures files reach the backend server first before being uploaded to the cloud.
    - The local file should be deleted once the cloud upload is successful to save storage space.
